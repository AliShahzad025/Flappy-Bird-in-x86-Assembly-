# Flappy-Bird-in-x86-Assembly-
Flappy Bird game implemented in x86 Assembly language using DOS interrupts

This project is a graphical clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed entirely in x86 Assembly language. It features complex problem-solving techniques to handle real-time bird movement, collision detection, 
scoring logic, and horizontal obstacle generation. The bird moves up on key press and falls due to simulated gravity.

Pillars scroll horizontally across the screen at a constant speed, and the player earns a score 
for each successful pass through the gaps. All animations, screen rendering, and game logic are managed using low-level interrupts and direct memory manipulation, showcasing advanced handling of control flow, 
delays, input/output, and data structures in Assembly.
